This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


This is a simple interview for front-end development. Still has improvements to be made as applying redux or zustand for controlling several components at once, allowing click on weekday not only on top buttons, but also in the expandible menu.
